# Hello World Overview
 
This program runs the classic "Hello World" message with a twist. The program starts with the Hello World then procceds to recount the tale of Darth Plague the Wise
from episode 3 of Star Wars. 

I created this program to ensure that my GitHub repositories are connecting and working correctly so that the projects I have completed can be view and displayed to 
potential employers.

# Development Environment

I used Python in the Visual Studios Code IDE. I also imported the libary of time to pause the print function within the program.

I untilized python to due my proficiency with the langauge as well as it's simplistic nature.
